In this code challenge, we were supposed to solve the problem with the following requirements:
 
Problem:

Write a command line program in the language of your choice that will take operations on fractions as an input and produce a fractional result.

* Legal operators shall be *, /, +, - (multiply, divide, add, subtract)

* Operands and operators shall be separated by one or more spaces

* Mixed numbers will be represented by whole_numerator/denominator. e.g. "3_1/4"

* Improper fractions and whole numbers are also allowed as operands

Solution:

Depending on were you copied the folder, the directory we name Fract, for exameple if you copied it on your C:\ you need to go to C:\Fract. From there you can compile it running :
 
 Compilation:
 
<Path>csc Program.cs  

Example : C:\Fract>csc Program.cs

If you get an error, several reasons might have cause it : 

-  .NET Framework is not installed (please install the .Net Framework)

- >NET Framework is not added to the system path, please run the code from C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\csc or the equivalent on your machine

Execution:

<Path>csc Program.exe

Example : C:\Fract>csc Program.exe
